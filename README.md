# 🖧NetPractice - Understanding Networking & Routing

## 📌 Overview
NetPractice is a project designed to reinforce fundamental networking concepts. The goal is to configure a series of network interfaces and routes to establish proper communication between different machines while ensuring correct subnetting and IP allocation.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Subnetting & IP Addressing (CIDR notation, subnet masks, and address calculations)
- Routing & Gateways (configuring network routes and gateways for proper packet delivery)
- Static Routing vs. Dynamic Routing
- Troubleshooting Network Issues

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
✅ Analyze different network topologies and plan proper subnetting

✅ Assign IP addresses & subnet masks correctly to avoid conflicts

✅ Define appropriate routes and gateways to ensure seamless communication

✅ Debug common networking errors and troubleshoot connectivity issues

## 🛠 How I Approached the Project
1️⃣ Understanding the Requirements: Before jumping into configurations, I first analyzed the given network diagrams and requirements. I identified key subnets, host allocations, and routing needs.

2️⃣ Subnet Calculations: Using CIDR notation and subnet masks, I divided networks appropriately, ensuring efficient IP allocation.

3️⃣ Route Configuration: I manually set up routing tables, ensuring correct traffic flow between hosts and routers.

4️⃣ Testing & Debugging: Finally, I reviewed all configurations, checked for misconfigured routes, and made necessary adjustments.

## 📂 Submitted Solution
The solutions.json file in this repository contains the final working configurations for all 10 levels of NetPractice. It consists of structured data defining:

- Routes: Custom routing tables for directing network traffic
- Interfaces: IP addresses and subnet masks assigned to each device

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Subnetting is the foundation of efficient networking. Understanding CIDR notation was as crucial as knowing how to calculate the usable amount of hosts per subnet, for avoiding address conflicts.
- Routing tables dictate how networks communicate. I learned how to direct packets efficiently between subnets.
- Debugging is key. One incorrect IP or subnet mask can break an entire network—double-checking configurations is crucial!

## 💭 Final Thoughts
This project was an incredible learning experience in networking fundamentals. While the initial levels felt simple, the later challenges truly tested my understanding of routing logic and subnet calculations. I now feel much more confident working with network configurations, which will be invaluable for future system administration, cybersecurity, or DevOps roles.
🌟 Looking forward to tackling more networking challenges ahead!
